### A Tale of Development 

The whole theme of Tic-Tac-Woah was born from writing woah instead of toe. I knew right away that when "woah" displayed on the screen that this would be the most bodacious of themes to run with and it ran away from **me**.

Come across a couple of hiccups on the road to gnardom, the most tricky part being coding who came out on top, üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or üåä! Working through the code logging and revisng to ensure all variables where containg the data they should be, I would like to stream line this area too. The draw function is also a bit messy and would like to smoothen that out.

New features would also be gnarly, like a option to choose your shredder. 

### Known Issues in Tic-Tac-Woah v  1.0

Music and ocean sound buttons need fixing. Only click one, once.
